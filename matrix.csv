31,What is the regulatory definition of e-money?,"""E-money means monetary value that is stored on an electronic device or server, accepted by undertakings other than the issuer, and generally intended to make payments or transfer money for another purpose, of a limited amount. E-money is not considered to be a deposit, as that term is defined in Article 1 of the Law of Banking in Afghanistan. Rather, cash-in/cash-out activities of [E-money institutions] are considered to be “check cashing,” and [money value transfer] transactions are considered to be “money transmission” as those terms are defined in Article 1 of the Law on Da Afghanistan Bank"" [Money Service Providers Regulation, 2.1.3., (k)].",N/A,N/A,N/A,"The Policy Guidelines identify three categories of prepaid instruments, which term includes smart cards, magnetic stripe cards, Internet wallets, and mobile accounts and wallets, paper vouchers. The three categories are: (i) “closed” system payment instruments, which may be used only for the purchase of goods and services from the issuer itself and therefore, as explicitly stated, are not classified as payment systems; (ii) “semi-closed” payment instruments, which may be used at a group of clearly identified merchant locations and/or establishments that have contracted to accept such instruments, but which may not be used for cash withdrawal or redemption; and (iii) “open” system payment instruments, which may be used at any point-of-sale (POS) enabled merchant and for cash withdrawal at automatic teller machines (ATMs) [Policy Guidelines for issuance and operation of PPIs, 2.3 - 2.6]","The E-Money Regulation defines e-money as a payment instrument that fulfils the following criteria: (a) It is issued against equal value of the money deposited by the customer to the issuer; (b) The nominal value of the money is stored electronically in a medium, such as a server or chip; (c) It serves as a payment instrument for merchants that are not the issuer of the e-money; (d) The value of the e-money deposited by the customer and managed by the issuer is not categorized as deposits, as defined by the Banking Act [E-Money Regulation, article 1, 3.]",N/A,"E-money is defined in the Payment Systems (Designated Payment Instruments) Order 2003 as ""a payment instrument, whether tangible or intangible that: (i) stores money electronically in exchange of funds paid to the issuer; and (ii) is able to be used as a means of making payment to any person other than the issuer"" [Guideline on Electronic Money, 5.1.1]. E-money ""can be issued in different forms, such as card-based (e.g. prepaid card) and network-based which can be accessible via the internet, mobile phones or any other devices"" [Guideline on Electronic Money, 1.2].

32,Who can issue e-money? Under what conditions can it be issued?,"An “e-money institution” (EMI) can be ""a legal entity, other than a commercial bank or depository microfinance institution, that accepts banknotes, coins, or other means of payment in exchange for e-money, and facilitates the transfer of this e-money to make payments. A commercial bank or depository microfinance institutions that allows its accountholders access to their funds, located in individual, numbered accounts that are liabilities of that commercial bank or DMFI, by means of an electronic device, such as a mobile telephone handset, is not considered to be an EMI for the purposes of this regulation. Similarly, the third-party vendor of a commercial bank or DMFI that provides EMI technology to give customers additional
electronic access channels to their funds are not considered to be money services providers for
the purposes of this regulation"" [Money Service Providers Regulation, 2.1.3., (m)]. In addition, ""the minimum capital requirement for an EMI consists of the sum of two components: AFN 10,000,000, plus 1.5 percent of historical average e-money"" [Money Service Providers Regulation, 2.5.4.]. Lastly, ""customers of an EMI must register as individuals"", and ""an EMI may not offer more than one account to the same customer"" [Money Service Providers Regulation, 2.5.12., 2.]. ","Although prepaid cards may not fall under the definition of deposit (because the prepaid funds may not be repayable), the requirement of the Banking Law that only CBB-licensed and supervised institutions are permitted to collect funds from third parties is generally viewed as prohibiting nonbanks from issuing e-money or other stored-value instruments, such as electronic accounts stored in mobile phones  [Source: Update on Regulation of Branchless Banking in Brazil, CGAP, January 2010].",N/A,N/A,"Only banks may issue all three types of instruments (and only those banks which have been permitted by RBI to provide mobile banking transactions may launch mobile accounts and wallets).

Licensing requirements for banks and for nonbank e-money issuers that have a float that is (or is projected to be) equal or greater than IDR 1 billion include the provision of the following documents: (i) an e-money profile containing information on technical specifications as well as e-money management mechanisms; (ii) first year business projections; (iii) proof of legal instrument readiness (i.e. concepts of written key agreements with partners); (iv) proof of operational readiness (e.g. an organizational structure plan and equipment and business facility plan); (v) proof of liquidity risk management readiness; (vi) an information technology audit from an independent auditor; (vii) a disaster recovery plan; (viii) identification of product risk and other risks like operational, legal, and reputational risks, and (x) a description of the accounting information system to be applied to the e-money issuance [E-Money Circular, articles II, C and D].","In the absence of any legal framework, the issuing of e-money by a licensed financial institution does not appear to raise any issues with CBK. With regard to nonbanks, CBK’s current approach seems to depend on whether the activities involved in e-money issuance fall under the definition of “banking business” in the Banking Act or “deposit-taking microfinance business” in the Microfinance Act. A nonbank can avoid falling under the definition of banking business by not lending, investing, or otherwise placing at the risk of such nonbank institution the funds mobilized (i.e., the e-money proceeds). It is likely that the same conclusion will apply to the definition of deposit-taking microfinance business, although the definition is less easy to interpret.
